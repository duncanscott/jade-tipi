TASK: TASK-015 — Update contents read service for root-shaped documents
DATE: 2026-05-01
SUMMARY: Updated `ContentsLinkReadService` so the contents read path
understands the root-shaped materialized `typ` and `lnk` documents
written by accepted `TASK-014`. Canonical `contents` link-type
declarations are now resolved against root-shaped `typ` documents using
the dotted criteria `properties.kind == "link_type"` AND
`properties.name == "contents"` (Spring Mongo
`Criteria.where("properties.kind").is(...)` /
`Criteria.where("properties.name").is(...)` over the `typ` collection,
sorted by `_id` ASC); the materializer copies every `typ + create`
payload field other than `id` and `type_id` into root `properties`, so a
`typ` declaration with `data.kind: "link_type"` and `data.name:
"contents"` now exposes those facts at `properties.kind` and
`properties.name`. The pre-`TASK-014` top-level `kind` / `name`
filtering would have returned zero declarations against root-shaped
`typ` rows and caused every contents read to short-circuit to empty.
`lnk` reads are unchanged in shape: the service continues to filter
`lnk.type_id $in <resolved type IDs>` and the requested endpoint field
(`left` for `findContents`, `right` for `findLocations`), sorts by `_id`
ASC, and never joins to `loc` or `ent`. Each materialized `lnk` row is
mapped verbatim into `ContentsLinkRecord` carrying the link `_id`,
top-level `type_id`, `left`, `right`, and instance `properties`
sub-document (including plate-well `properties.position`). Provenance
mapping moved off legacy top-level `_jt_provenance` to the new reserved
`_head.provenance` location written by `CommittedTransactionMaterializer`
(carrying `txn_id`, `commit_id`, `msg_uuid`, source `collection`, source
`action`, `committed_at`, and `materialized_at`). A small explicit
fallback to legacy top-level `_jt_provenance` is preserved for documents
materialized before the root shape was adopted, per the accepted
`TASK-013`/`TASK-015` allowance — the fallback is a single private
helper branch (`extractProvenance(Map row)`) that reads
`_head.provenance` first when `_head` is a map containing a `provenance`
sub-map and falls back to top-level `_jt_provenance` only when the
canonical location is missing or has no `provenance` sub-map. When
neither source is present, `provenance` is `null`, preserving the
existing wire contract. No production change was made to
`ContentsLinkReadController` (routes still bind to
`GET /api/contents/by-container/{id}` and
`GET /api/contents/by-content/{id}`, both delegate to the read service,
both return a flat `Flux<ContentsLinkRecord>` JSON array, blank/whitespace
ids still flow through service `Assert.hasText(...)` and
`GlobalExceptionHandler` as 400 `ErrorResponse`, and the controller has
only `ContentsLinkReadService` as a constructor collaborator). No
production change was made to `ContentsLinkRecord` either; the
serialized field set, types, and `provenance` map shape stay the same,
so the controller spec's existing JSON-path assertions on
`provenance.txn_id`, `provenance.commit_id`, `provenance.msg_uuid`,
`provenance.committed_at`, and `provenance.materialized_at` keep
passing — only the source of `provenance` moves inside the service. The
`ContentsLinkRecord` doc comment was refreshed to point at
`_head.provenance` with the legacy fallback note. Internally the
service's static field constants were retargeted: `FIELD_KIND` and
`FIELD_NAME` were removed (no longer used as top-level criteria) and
replaced with dotted constants `FIELD_PROPERTIES_KIND =
"properties.kind"` and `FIELD_PROPERTIES_NAME = "properties.name"`;
`FIELD_PROVENANCE = "_jt_provenance"` was replaced with
`FIELD_HEAD = "_head"`, `HEAD_PROVENANCE = "provenance"`, and
`FIELD_PROVENANCE_LEGACY = "_jt_provenance"` (kept only while the
fallback exists). Field constants for `lnk` mapping (`FIELD_TYPE_ID`,
`FIELD_LEFT`, `FIELD_RIGHT`, `FIELD_PROPERTIES`) and the canonical
`COLLECTION_TYP`, `COLLECTION_LNK`, `LINK_TYPE_KIND`,
`CONTENTS_TYPE_NAME`, and `FIELD_ID` constants are unchanged.
`ContentsLinkReadServiceSpec` was rewritten to drive the service with
root-shaped fixtures: `typRow(...)` now builds a self-describing root
with top-level `_id`, `id`, `collection: 'typ'`, `type_id: null`, root
`properties: [kind: 'link_type', name: 'contents']`, empty `links`, and
`_head.provenance` carrying `txn_id`, `commit_id`, `msg_uuid`,
source `collection`, source `action`, `committed_at`, and
`materialized_at`. `lnkRow(...)` now writes a root-shaped `lnk` with
top-level `_id`, `id`, `collection: 'lnk'`, `type_id`, `left`, `right`,
verbatim `properties.position` plate-well shape, empty `links`, and
`_head.provenance` (no top-level `_jt_provenance` on new root rows). A
new `legacyLnkRow(...)` helper builds the pre-`TASK-014` copied-data
shape (no `_head`, top-level `_jt_provenance`) for fallback coverage.
Captured-criteria assertions were updated to assert the dotted typ
criteria keys: `typQueryDoc.get('properties.kind') == 'link_type'` and
`typQueryDoc.get('properties.name') == 'contents'`; lnk query
assertions (`type_id $in`, endpoint key, `_id` ASC sort) are unchanged.
Provenance coverage was expanded from the old single
"missing-`_jt_provenance` returns null" case to four cases:
(1) canonical provenance read from `_head.provenance` on
forward and reverse lookups including the new source `collection`/
`action` keys; (2) legacy fallback to top-level `_jt_provenance` when
the document has no `_head`; (3) `_head: null` on an otherwise
root-shaped `lnk` (with no `_jt_provenance`) returns `null`
provenance; (4) `_head` present but with no `provenance` sub-map and no
`_jt_provenance` returns `null` provenance. Forward/reverse "verbatim
fields and provenance" features assert provenance fields read from
`_head.provenance`. The remaining features
(empty-typ short-circuit, empty-lnk results, no `loc`/`ent` joins,
unresolved-endpoint pass-through, mixed-collection forward results,
non-matching `typ` rows ignored, blank-id rejection, and
no-write assertions) preserve their behavior on the new root-shaped
fixtures. `ContentsLinkReadController` and
`ContentsLinkReadControllerSpec` are unchanged because the wire shape
is stable. `docs/architecture/kafka-transaction-message-vocabulary.md`
was updated only inside the "Reading `contents` Links" section: the
typ resolution language now describes
`properties.kind == "link_type"` and
`properties.name == "contents"` against root-shaped documents and
explains why dotted-path criteria match the materializer's root
shape; the per-record description now points at the
`_head.provenance` sub-document and notes the explicit narrow
fallback to legacy `_jt_provenance` for pre-`TASK-014` rows. The
adjacent "Committed Materialization Of Locations And Links" section
still describes the pre-`TASK-014` copied-data shape; that
materialization-section currency work was deferred from this task per
director decision and remains a separate `TASK-014` doc follow-up.
No changes were made to `CommittedTransactionMaterializer`,
`TransactionMessagePersistenceService`, Kafka listener behavior,
committed snapshot shape, DTO schemas, canonical examples, Docker
Compose, Gradle files, security, frontend, response envelopes,
pagination, endpoint joins to `loc`/`ent`, semantic reference
validation, endpoint projection maintenance, extension pages, pending
pages, update/delete replay, backfill, transaction-overlay reads,
required properties, default values, or integration coverage.
`TASK-012` was not resumed. Owned-paths boundary was respected: edits
stayed within
`jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/ContentsLinkReadService.groovy`,
`jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/ContentsLinkRecord.groovy`,
`jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/ContentsLinkReadServiceSpec.groovy`,
`docs/architecture/kafka-transaction-message-vocabulary.md`, and
`docs/agents/claude-1-changes.md`.
`ContentsLinkReadController.groovy`,
`ContentsLinkReadControllerSpec.groovy`, and
`docs/orchestrator/tasks/TASK-015-root-shaped-contents-read-service.md`
are also on the task's `OWNED_PATHS` and were left untouched in this
turn (no production controller change was needed; the existing
controller spec already exercises the stable wire shape).
VERIFICATION: docker compose stack already healthy
(`jade-tipi-mongo`, `jade-tipi-kafka`, `jade-tipi-keycloak` all up;
`docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps` confirmed).
`./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileGroovy` BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
`./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileTestGroovy` BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
`./gradlew :jade-tipi:test --tests '*ContentsLinkReadServiceSpec*'`
BUILD SUCCESSFUL with the rewritten spec at
`tests=20, failures=0, errors=0, skipped=0` (was 14 features yielding
18 tests after `TASK-010`; the rewrite adds the legacy-fallback case
plus the `_head` null and `_head` without `provenance` cases on top of
the dotted-criteria refresh).
`./gradlew :jade-tipi:test --tests '*ContentsLinkReadControllerSpec*'`
BUILD SUCCESSFUL with the unchanged spec at
`tests=10, failures=0, errors=0, skipped=0`.
`./gradlew :jade-tipi:test` BUILD SUCCESSFUL with the full unit suite
at `tests=113, failures=0, errors=0, skipped=0` (113 = 107 from
post-`TASK-011` baseline plus the +6 `ContentsLinkReadServiceSpec`
delta noted above).
NOTES: The legacy `_jt_provenance` fallback is a single explicit
branch in `ContentsLinkReadService.extractProvenance(Map row)` that
runs only when the canonical `_head.provenance` location is missing
or non-map. It was retained per the accepted pre-work allowance for
the copied-data-shape transition and can be removed in a focused
follow-up once stale legacy `lnk` rows are confirmed gone (one branch
plus one Spock case to delete). The "Committed Materialization Of
Locations And Links" section of
`docs/architecture/kafka-transaction-message-vocabulary.md` still
reflects the pre-`TASK-014` copied-data shape and is now stale; per
director direction this remains a separate doc follow-up to
`TASK-014` rather than in-scope for `TASK-015`.

STATUS: READY_FOR_REVIEW
TASK: TASK-014 — Implement root-shaped materialized documents
DATE: 2026-05-01
SUMMARY: Updated `CommittedTransactionMaterializer` so the currently
supported committed `loc + create`, `typ + create` (only when
`data.kind == "link_type"`), and `lnk + create` messages now write the
accepted `TASK-013` root document shape instead of the provisional
copied-data shape. The supported-message boundary, snapshot input via
`CommittedTransactionReadService`, missing/blank `data.id` skip,
unsupported-message skip, snapshot ordering, and non-duplicate insert
error propagation are unchanged. Each materialized document now has
`_id == data.id`, `id == data.id`, top-level
`collection == message.collection`, top-level `type_id`, explicit
`properties`, denormalized `links`, and a reserved `_head` sub-document.
For `loc` and `typ link_type` the materializer copies every payload
field other than `id` and `type_id` into root `properties` (so the
canonical location example carries `name` and `description` under
`properties`, and the `contents` link-type declaration carries `kind`,
`name`, `description`, `left_role`, `right_role`,
`left_to_right_label`, `right_to_left_label`, `allowed_left_collections`,
and `allowed_right_collections` under `properties`); top-level
`type_id` is taken from `data.type_id` when present and is `null`
otherwise. For `lnk` the materializer puts top-level `type_id`, `left`,
and `right` from the payload at the root and mirrors `data.properties`
under root `properties`, defaulting to `{}` when the payload omits it
(so the plate-well coordinate at `properties.position` is preserved
verbatim). For every supported root in this iteration `links` is an
empty map; per the accepted `TASK-013` decision, no endpoint stubs are
created and no endpoint `links` projections are populated, leaving
endpoint projection maintenance to a later task. `_head` carries
`schema_version: 1`, `document_kind: "root"`, `root_id == _id`, and a
nested `provenance` map with `txn_id`, `commit_id`, `msg_uuid`, source
`collection`, source `action`, `committed_at`, and a fresh
`materialized_at` `Instant`. The legacy reserved `_jt_provenance`
field is no longer written on new roots; provenance moved to
`_head.provenance`. Duplicate-id handling preserves prior behavior:
matching duplicates are idempotent successes (`duplicateMatching++`),
differing duplicates are logged at error and counted
(`conflictingDuplicate++`) without overwrite, a single conflict does
not block subsequent messages in the same snapshot, and non-duplicate
insert failures still propagate the original `Throwable`. Duplicate
comparison now ignores only `_head.provenance.materialized_at` so
retried matching payloads remain idempotent while every other payload
or provenance difference (including `commit_id`, `msg_uuid`, source
`action`, or any `properties` value) still surfaces as a conflict.
Internally, `buildDocument` was rewritten around four root-shape
helpers (`buildInlineProperties`, `copyProperties`, `buildHead`, and
`stripVolatileFields`); the materializer's static field constants were
expanded for the new root namespace (`FIELD_COLLECTION`,
`FIELD_TYPE_ID`, `FIELD_LEFT`, `FIELD_RIGHT`, `FIELD_PROPERTIES`,
`FIELD_LINKS`, `FIELD_HEAD`, `HEAD_*`, `PROV_COLLECTION`,
`PROV_ACTION`); `FIELD_PROVENANCE = '_jt_provenance'` was removed.
`CommittedTransactionMaterializerSpec` was rewritten to assert the
root shape on `loc`, `typ link_type`, and `lnk` (top-level `_id`,
`id`, `collection`, `type_id`, `left`/`right` for `lnk`, explicit
`properties`, empty `links`, and `_head` schema metadata + provenance
keys including `collection` and `action`), to confirm new roots do
not carry `_jt_provenance`, to add a `loc` case where `data.type_id`
is set so it appears at the root and is excluded from `properties`,
to add a `lnk` case with no payload `properties` that defaults root
`properties` to `{}`, to assert `_head.provenance` differences other
than `materialized_at` (e.g. differing `commit_id`) still surface as
conflicts, to assert non-duplicate insert errors propagate without
hitting `findById`, and to reshape the existing duplicate scenarios
(matching, differing, single-conflict-not-blocking) so the existing
documents are stored in the new root shape with full
`_head.provenance`. Identifiers, IDs, and helper messages
(`locMessage`, `linkTypeMessage`, `linkMessage`, `entityTypeMessage`,
`entityCreateMessage`, `propertyCreateMessage`,
`updateLocationMessage`, `springDuplicate`) and unrelated lifecycle
features (`materialize(txnId)` empty/non-empty, blank txnId, null
snapshot, mixed ordering across `loc`/`typ`/`lnk` with `ppy`/`ent`
skips) were preserved. No changes to `ContentsLinkReadService`,
`ContentsLinkRecord`, `ContentsLinkReadController`, integration
tests, DTO schemas, canonical examples, Docker Compose, Gradle files,
Kafka listener behavior, security, frontend, response envelopes,
pagination, endpoint joins, semantic reference validation, endpoint
projection maintenance, extension pages, pending pages, update/delete
replay, backfill, transaction-overlay reads, required properties, or
default values were made; `TASK-012` was not resumed. Owned-paths
boundary was respected: edits stayed within
`jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/CommittedTransactionMaterializer.groovy`,
`jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/CommittedTransactionMaterializerSpec.groovy`,
`docs/agents/claude-1-changes.md`, and (left untouched in this turn)
the active task file
`docs/orchestrator/tasks/TASK-014-materialized-root-document-materializer.md`.
VERIFICATION: docker compose stack already healthy
(`jade-tipi-mongo`, `jade-tipi-kafka`, `jade-tipi-keycloak` all up;
`docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps` confirmed).
`./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileGroovy` BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
`./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileTestGroovy` BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
`./gradlew :jade-tipi:test --tests '*CommittedTransactionMaterializerSpec*'`
BUILD SUCCESSFUL with the rewritten spec at
`tests=23, failures=0, errors=0, skipped=0` (was 16 features yielding
22 tests after TASK-009; the rewrite adds explicit `data.type_id`
loc, lnk-without-properties default, conflicting `_head.provenance`
when only `materialized_at` is allowed to differ, and non-duplicate
insert error propagation while consolidating shape assertions).
`./gradlew :jade-tipi:test` BUILD SUCCESSFUL with the full unit suite
green across all 11 specs at zero failures and zero errors:
`CommittedTransactionMaterializerSpec` (23),
`CommittedTransactionReadControllerSpec` (5),
`ContentsLinkReadControllerSpec` (10), `JadetipiApplicationTests`
(1), `TransactionMessageListenerSpec` (4), `MongoDbInitializerSpec`
(2), `DocumentServiceMongoDbImplSpec` (9),
`CommittedTransactionReadServiceSpec` (12),
`ContentsLinkReadServiceSpec` (18),
`TransactionMessagePersistenceServiceSpec` (15), and
`TransactionServiceSpec` (12) — 111 tests in total. No integration
tests were run because TASK-014 is unit-only and the directives list
no integration verification target.

STATUS: READY_FOR_REVIEW
TASK: TASK-011 — Plan contents location HTTP read adapter
DATE: 2026-05-01
SUMMARY: Implemented the smallest HTTP/WebFlux adapter over the accepted
`ContentsLinkReadService` so callers can answer the two `DIRECTION.md`
contents questions through the backend without changing materialization,
write semantics, or service-level query behavior. New
`jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/controller/ContentsLinkReadController.groovy`
is a thin `@RestController` whose constructor takes only
`ContentsLinkReadService` (no Mongo, no materializer, no write-side
collaborators). It uses `@RequestMapping('/api/contents')` and exposes two
`@GetMapping` methods returning `Flux<ContentsLinkRecord>` directly:
`GET /api/contents/by-container/{id}` delegates to
`ContentsLinkReadService.findContents(id)` (forward, `lnk.left == id`,
"what are the contents of this container?") and
`GET /api/contents/by-content/{id}` delegates to
`ContentsLinkReadService.findLocations(id)` (reverse, `lnk.right == id`,
"where is this object located?"). Both methods take
`@PathVariable('id') String id` and an unused
`@AuthenticationPrincipal Jwt jwt` parameter for parity with
`CommittedTransactionReadController`; controller-side authorization,
scoping policy, pagination, response envelope, and endpoint-resolution
joins to `loc`/`ent` were all kept out. Empty service results map to
HTTP 200 with body `[]` (the WebFlux default for `Flux<T>`); blank or
whitespace-only ids surface the service `Assert.hasText(...)`
`IllegalArgumentException` as a 400 `ErrorResponse` through the existing
`GlobalExceptionHandler`, with `status=400`, `error="Bad Request"`, and
the service's exact `containerId/objectId must not be blank` message.
Neither route returns 404; the empty-array contract intentionally
collapses "no canonical `contents` declaration", "no matching `lnk`
rows", and "endpoint id absent in `loc`/`ent`" into one HTTP status so
HTTP cannot lie about materialization timing or speak about
`loc`/`ent` resolution. New unit spec
`jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/controller/ContentsLinkReadControllerSpec.groovy`
mirrors `CommittedTransactionReadControllerSpec`: it builds a
`WebTestClient.bindToController(controller)` with the real
`GlobalExceptionHandler` advice and the
`AuthenticationPrincipalArgumentResolver` from
`ReactiveAdapterRegistry.getSharedInstance()`, mocks only the
`ContentsLinkReadService` collaborator, and runs 10 focused features.
Forward coverage: 200 JSON serialization including `linkId`, `typeId`,
`left`, `right`, nested `properties.position` (`kind`, `label`, `row`,
`column`) for plate-well placements, and the full `_jt_provenance`
sub-document (`txn_id`, `commit_id`, `msg_uuid`, `committed_at`,
`materialized_at`); service-order preservation across two records;
single-collaborator delegation with `1 * findContents(...)` and
`0 * _`; 200 `[]` on `Flux.empty()`; whitespace-only id 400 path through
the real `GlobalExceptionHandler` with the service's literal blank
message. Reverse coverage mirrors all four. Structural coverage adds a
reflection assertion that the only constructor argument is
`ContentsLinkReadService` (matching the `CommittedTransactionReadController`
precedent) and a literal route-path assertion that pins
`/api/contents/by-container/{id}` and `/api/contents/by-content/{id}` so
a rename in either direction breaks the spec. A short HTTP-route
paragraph was appended to the existing "Reading `contents` Links"
section of `docs/architecture/kafka-transaction-message-vocabulary.md`,
documenting both routes, the empty-array success contract, and the 400
path through `GlobalExceptionHandler`. No new HTTP DTO, no new exception
handler, no `SecurityConfig` change, no `application.yml` change, no
build-file change, no Docker Compose change, no
DTO/schema/example/frontend change, no `ContentsLinkReadService`
semantic change, no controller-side input validation, and no
integration test were added. `OUT_OF_SCOPE` boundaries from the task
file are preserved in full.
VERIFICATION: docker compose stack already healthy (`jade-tipi-mongo`,
`jade-tipi-kafka`, `jade-tipi-keycloak` all up; `docker compose ps`
confirmed). `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileGroovy` BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
`./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileTestGroovy` BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
`./gradlew :jade-tipi:test --tests '*ContentsLinkReadControllerSpec*'`
BUILD SUCCESSFUL with the new spec at
`tests=10, failures=0, errors=0, skipped=0`. `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test`
BUILD SUCCESSFUL with the full unit suite at `tests=107, failures=0,
errors=0, skipped=0` across 11 specs (was 97 across 10 specs after
TASK-010; +10 new in `ContentsLinkReadControllerSpec`), including
`CommittedTransactionReadControllerSpec` (5),
`ContentsLinkReadServiceSpec` (18),
`CommittedTransactionMaterializerSpec` (19),
`CommittedTransactionReadServiceSpec` (12),
`TransactionMessagePersistenceServiceSpec` (15), and
`JadetipiApplicationTests.contextLoads` (1).

## TASK-011 — Plan contents location HTTP read adapter

Director moved `TASK-011` to `READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION` on 2026-05-01
with implementation directives recorded in the
`TASK-011 Director Pre-work Review` block of `DIRECTIVES.md` (signal
`PROCEED_TO_IMPLEMENTATION`) and reflected in the
`docs/orchestrator/tasks/TASK-011-contents-location-http-read-adapter-prework.md`
`LATEST_REPORT`. Implementation done on 2026-05-01.

### Production source changes

- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/controller/ContentsLinkReadController.groovy`
  (new) — thin WebFlux read adapter over `ContentsLinkReadService`.
  - `@Slf4j @RestController @RequestMapping('/api/contents')`.
  - Single-arg constructor: `ContentsLinkReadController(ContentsLinkReadService readService)`.
    Stays Kafka-free, Mongo-free, materializer-free, write-side-free at the
    controller layer.
  - `@GetMapping('/by-container/{id}') Flux<ContentsLinkRecord>
    getContentsByContainer(@PathVariable('id') String id,
    @AuthenticationPrincipal Jwt jwt)` — forward lookup, returns
    `readService.findContents(id)` directly.
  - `@GetMapping('/by-content/{id}') Flux<ContentsLinkRecord>
    getContentsByContent(@PathVariable('id') String id,
    @AuthenticationPrincipal Jwt jwt)` — reverse lookup, returns
    `readService.findLocations(id)` directly.
  - One `log.debug` per route mirrors
    `CommittedTransactionReadController.getSnapshot`. The `jwt` parameter is
    unused inside both bodies; it is present for parity with the existing
    authenticated read controller and to keep the
    `AuthenticationPrincipalArgumentResolver` chain identical for all
    `/api/**` reads.
  - No `Mono<ResponseEntity<...>>`, no `block()`, no `collectList()`, no
    re-sort, no dedup, no in-memory filter, no `defaultIfEmpty`. The
    Spring WebFlux runtime serializes `Flux<T>` as a flat JSON array,
    using the empty body `[]` for an empty stream — no controller-side
    code is needed for the empty-result contract.
  - No controller-side input validation; blank/whitespace ids hit the
    service `Assert.hasText(...)` and surface through
    `GlobalExceptionHandler.handleIllegalArgument` as a 400
    `ErrorResponse`.

### Test changes

- `jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/controller/ContentsLinkReadControllerSpec.groovy`
  (new) — pure Spock controller spec.
  - `Mock(ContentsLinkReadService)` is the only collaborator; no Spring
    context, no Mongo, no Kafka, no Keycloak.
  - `WebTestClient.bindToController(controller)` builds the test client,
    `.controllerAdvice(new GlobalExceptionHandler())` wires the real
    advice, and `.argumentResolvers { ... addCustomResolver(new
    AuthenticationPrincipalArgumentResolver(ReactiveAdapterRegistry
    .getSharedInstance())) }` lets `@AuthenticationPrincipal Jwt jwt`
    resolve to `null` without a server, exactly as in
    `CommittedTransactionReadControllerSpec`.
  - Coverage (10 features):
    1. Forward route 200 JSON serialization preserves `linkId`, `typeId`,
       `left`, `right`, `properties.position.{kind,label,row,column}`, and
       `provenance.{txn_id,commit_id,msg_uuid,committed_at,
       materialized_at}` for two records, asserted via `jsonPath`.
    2. Forward route delegates to `findContents(...)` only;
       `1 * readService.findContents(CONTAINER_ID) >> ...` plus `0 * _`
       proves no other collaborator is touched.
    3. Forward route 200 with empty array (`$.length() == 0`) when
       service emits `Flux.empty()`; status is **not** 404.
    4. Forward route blank id (`'   '`) flows through service
       `Assert.hasText` to a 400 `ErrorResponse` whose `status == 400`,
       `error == 'Bad Request'`, and `message ==
       'containerId must not be blank'`.
    5. Reverse route 200 JSON serialization preserves identical fields
       for two records.
    6. Reverse route delegates to `findLocations(...)` only with
       `0 * _`.
    7. Reverse route 200 empty array on `Flux.empty()`.
    8. Reverse route blank id surfaces
       `'objectId must not be blank'` as 400.
    9. Reflection assertion: only constructor parameter is
       `ContentsLinkReadService` (matches the
       `CommittedTransactionReadControllerSpec`
       `controller has no direct Mongo collaborator` precedent).
    10. Literal route-path assertion pinning
        `/api/contents/by-container/{id}` and
        `/api/contents/by-content/{id}` so a rename in either direction
        breaks the spec.
  - No integration spec is added; service-level Mongo-query coverage
    already lives in `ContentsLinkReadServiceSpec` from TASK-010.

### Documentation changes

- `docs/architecture/kafka-transaction-message-vocabulary.md` — appended
  a short HTTP-route paragraph to the existing "Reading `contents` Links"
  section: documents the two routes, the empty-array success contract
  (HTTP 200 with `[]`), the 400 path through `GlobalExceptionHandler` for
  blank ids, and the no-Mongo/no-materializer/no-write-side controller
  collaborator boundary.

### Items intentionally NOT changed

- `ContentsLinkReadService.groovy` and `ContentsLinkRecord.groovy` —
  service query semantics, sort order, type-resolution policy, and value
  object are frozen per `OUT_OF_SCOPE`.
- `ContentsLinkReadServiceSpec.groovy` — service-level coverage from
  TASK-010 is unchanged.
- `SecurityConfig.groovy` — JWT auth on `/api/**` already covers both
  new routes; no permit-list edit needed.
- `GlobalExceptionHandler.groovy` — existing
  `IllegalArgumentException → 400 ErrorResponse` advice already returns
  the desired body; no new handler.
- `CommittedTransactionReadController`, `CommittedTransactionReadService`,
  `CommittedTransactionMaterializer`, `TransactionMessagePersistenceService`,
  `TransactionMessageListener`, and their value objects.
- `MongoDbInitializer` — `lnk` and `typ` are already enum-driven from
  TASK-007.
- `libraries/jade-tipi-dto/...` — no DTO, schema, or message-example
  change.
- `application.yml`, `build.gradle`, `docker-compose.yml`,
  `DIRECTION.md`, frontend, integration-test sources.

### Verification

- Docker stack healthy before verification: `jade-tipi-mongo`,
  `jade-tipi-kafka`, `jade-tipi-keycloak` all up (`docker compose ps`
  confirmed).
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileGroovy` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileTestGroovy` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test --tests '*ContentsLinkReadControllerSpec*'`
  → BUILD SUCCESSFUL; `ContentsLinkReadControllerSpec`
  `tests=10, failures=0, errors=0, skipped=0`.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL; full unit suite
  `tests=107, failures=0, errors=0, skipped=0` across 11 specs (was 97
  across 10 specs after TASK-010; +10 new in
  `ContentsLinkReadControllerSpec`). Suite breakdown:
  `CommittedTransactionReadControllerSpec=5`,
  `ContentsLinkReadControllerSpec=10`,
  `JadetipiApplicationTests=1`,
  `TransactionMessageListenerSpec=4`,
  `MongoDbInitializerSpec=2`,
  `DocumentServiceMongoDbImplSpec=9`,
  `CommittedTransactionMaterializerSpec=19`,
  `CommittedTransactionReadServiceSpec=12`,
  `ContentsLinkReadServiceSpec=18`,
  `TransactionMessagePersistenceServiceSpec=15`,
  `TransactionServiceSpec=12`.

## TASK-010 — Plan contents location query reads

Director moved `TASK-010` to `READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION` on 2026-05-01
with implementation directives recorded in the
`TASK-010 Director Pre-work Review` block of `DIRECTIVES.md` (signal
`PROCEED_TO_IMPLEMENTATION`) and reflected in the
`docs/orchestrator/tasks/TASK-010-contents-location-query-read-prework.md`
`LATEST_REPORT`. Implementation done on 2026-05-01.

### Production source changes

- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/ContentsLinkReadService.groovy`
  (new) — the Kafka-free / HTTP-free reader.
  - Constructor takes only `ReactiveMongoTemplate`; no Kafka, HTTP, or
    listener dependency.
  - Public surface: `Flux<ContentsLinkRecord> findContents(String containerId)`
    and `Flux<ContentsLinkRecord> findLocations(String objectId)`.
  - Private `resolveContentsTypeIds()` queries `typ` for documents with
    `kind == 'link_type' AND name == 'contents'`, sorted ASC by `_id`,
    and emits each non-blank `_id` as a `Flux<String>`.
  - For each public method, the resolved IDs are collected into a list;
    if empty, the method returns `Flux.empty()` and never queries `lnk`.
    Otherwise the service runs one `lnk` query with
    `Criteria.where('type_id').in(typeIds).and(<endpoint>).is(<id>)`,
    sorted ASC by `_id`.
  - `Assert.hasText(containerId|objectId, ...)` rejects blank input
    eagerly at the entry point with `IllegalArgumentException`.
  - Each returned `ContentsLinkRecord` is built by `toRecord(Map row)`
    via field-by-field cast: `linkId = row._id`, `typeId = row.type_id`,
    `left`, `right`, `properties = row.properties`, and
    `provenance = row._jt_provenance` (verbatim; `null` is preserved).
  - Constants for collection names, field names, the link-type kind,
    and the contents type name are exposed as `static final` fields so
    later tests or callers can reuse them without string duplication.

- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/ContentsLinkRecord.groovy`
  (new) — Groovy `@Immutable` value object carrying `linkId`, `typeId`,
  `left`, `right`, `properties` (`Map<String, Object>`), and `provenance`
  (`Map<String, Object>`). Lives in the same `service` package as
  `CommittedTransactionMessage` for consistency with that precedent;
  Javadoc spells out the verbatim semantics and that endpoint resolution
  is not performed at this boundary.

### Doc changes

- `docs/architecture/kafka-transaction-message-vocabulary.md` — added a
  short "Reading `contents` Links" section between the existing
  "Committed Materialization Of Locations And Links" section and
  "Reference Examples". The new section names the service surface
  (`findContents`/`findLocations`), the canonical-type resolution rule,
  the `Flux.empty()` short-circuit when no `contents` declaration
  exists, the `_id` ASC ordering, the verbatim record fields including
  `provenance`, the explicit non-join semantics for `loc`/`ent`, and the
  `IllegalArgumentException` boundary behavior.

### Tests

- `jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/ContentsLinkReadServiceSpec.groovy`
  (new) — pure Spock with `Mock(ReactiveMongoTemplate)`, modeled on
  `CommittedTransactionReadServiceSpec`. 18 features:
  - `findContents` — single-match round-trip with verbatim
    `properties.position` (`{kind: 'plate_well', label: 'A1', row: 'A',
    column: 1}`) and verbatim `_jt_provenance` (`txn_id`, `commit_id`,
    `msg_uuid`, `committed_at`, `materialized_at`).
  - `findContents` — captured `Query` proofs: typ criteria
    `kind=link_type AND name=contents`, typ sort `_id ASC`, lnk
    criteria `type_id $in [id1, id2]`, lnk `left == containerId` (no
    `right` clause), lnk sort `_id ASC`. The order assertion is the
    captured `sortObject`, not mock iteration order.
  - `findContents` — `Flux.empty()` when no contents type declared,
    with `0 * mongoTemplate.find(_, Map.class, 'lnk')` proving the
    `lnk` query is not even built.
  - `findContents` — empty result when contents type exists but no
    matching `lnk`; `0 *` `loc`/`ent`/`findById` calls prove the
    reader does not consult those collections to decide.
  - `findContents` — a `lnk` whose `right` would not resolve in
    `loc`/`ent` is still returned verbatim; `0 *` `loc`/`ent`
    `find`/`findById` calls.
  - `findLocations` — symmetric single-match round-trip and captured
    `Query` proof (`right == objectId`, no `left` clause, `type_id
    $in [id]`, sort `_id ASC`).
  - `findLocations` — `Flux.empty()` when no contents type declared,
    `0 *` `lnk` find.
  - `findLocations` — accepts links whose `left` is a `loc` ID and
    whose `left` is a different `loc` ID (covers
    `allowed_left_collections == ['loc']` reality without forcing a
    cross-collection assumption).
  - Type-discriminator — captured typ `Query` proves both
    `kind=link_type` AND `name=contents` are required, and the lnk
    `$in` only carries the resolved canonical IDs.
  - Materialized `lnk` missing `_jt_provenance` returns
    `provenance == null` rather than dropping the row.
  - Blank inputs — `findContents(input)` and `findLocations(input)`
    each throw `IllegalArgumentException` over a `where:` data table
    (`null`, `''`, `'   '`); `0 * mongoTemplate.find(_, _, _)` and
    `0 * mongoTemplate.findById(_, _, _)` confirm Mongo is not
    touched.
  - No-write proof — after one forward and one reverse query,
    asserts `0 * mongoTemplate.insert(_, _)`,
    `0 * mongoTemplate.insert(_)`, `0 * mongoTemplate.save(_, _)`,
    `0 * mongoTemplate.save(_)`, `0 * mongoTemplate.updateFirst(_, _, _)`,
    `0 * mongoTemplate.updateMulti(_, _, _)`,
    `0 * mongoTemplate.remove(_, _)`, and `0 * mongoTemplate.remove(_)`.

### Out-of-scope items confirmed not changed

- No controller (`jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/controller/`
  is unchanged); no HTTP submission rebuild, no security policy edit,
  and no `GlobalExceptionHandler` change.
- `CommittedTransactionMaterializer`, `CommittedTransactionReadService`,
  `TransactionMessagePersistenceService`, `TransactionService`,
  `DocumentService`, `CommittedTransactionSnapshot`,
  `CommittedTransactionMessage`, `KafkaProvenance`, `MaterializeResult`,
  and `PersistResult` are unchanged.
- DTO library (`libraries/jade-tipi-dto`), JSON schema
  (`message.schema.json`), message examples
  (`libraries/jade-tipi-dto/src/main/resources/example/message/*.json`),
  Kafka listener / topic configuration, build files
  (`build.gradle`, `gradle.properties`, `settings.gradle`),
  `docker/docker-compose.yml`, and `application.yml` are unchanged.
- `loc` records still do not carry `parent_location_id`; containment
  remains canonical in `lnk`.
- No update/delete replay, no backfill jobs, no background workers,
  no multi-transaction conflict resolution, no authorization/scoping
  policy, and no integration spec is added in this task.

### Verification

Pre-existing Docker stack already healthy (`docker ps` shows
`jade-tipi-mongo`, `jade-tipi-kafka`, `jade-tipi-keycloak` running);
the project-documented `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml
--profile mongodb up -d` was therefore not re-issued.

- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileGroovy` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileTestGroovy` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test --tests '*ContentsLinkReadServiceSpec*'`
  — BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Spec report:
  `tests=18, failures=0, errors=0, skipped=0` (all 18 features green).
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Aggregated unit-suite
  report: `tests=97, failures=0, errors=0, skipped=0` across 10 specs
  (was 79 across 9 specs at the end of TASK-009; the only delta is the
  new `ContentsLinkReadServiceSpec` adding 18 features).

The DTO library was intentionally not rebuilt
(`./gradlew :libraries:jade-tipi-dto:test` is not required for
`TASK-010` because no DTO/schema/example changed). No integration
spec was added or run; integration coverage stays deferred per the
director's pre-work review.

## TASK-009 — Plan committed location/link materialization

Director moved `TASK-009` to `READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION` on 2026-05-01 with
implementation directives in
`docs/orchestrator/tasks/TASK-009-committed-location-link-materialization-prework.md`
and the `TASK-009 Director Pre-work Review` block in `DIRECTIVES.md`
(signal `PROCEED_TO_IMPLEMENTATION`). Implementation done on 2026-05-01.

### Production source changes

- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/CommittedTransactionMaterializer.groovy`
  (new) — the Kafka-free / HTTP-free `@Service`.
  - Constructor takes `ReactiveMongoTemplate` and
    `CommittedTransactionReadService`. No Kafka, no HTTP, no listener.
  - `Mono<MaterializeResult> materialize(CommittedTransactionSnapshot)` —
    walks `snapshot.messages` (sorted ASC by `_id` upstream by the read
    service) with `Flux.fromIterable(...).concatMap(...)` so insert order
    matches snapshot order. Returns a `MaterializeResult` carrying the five
    counts. Returns `Mono.empty()` for a `null` snapshot.
  - `Mono<MaterializeResult> materialize(String txnId)` — convenience
    overload that delegates to
    `CommittedTransactionReadService.findCommitted(txnId)` and returns
    `Mono.empty()` when the transaction is not visible as committed (so the
    committed-visibility gate is reused, not re-implemented). Validates
    `txnId` via `Assert.hasText`.
  - `processMessage(...)` filters to supported (collection, action, kind)
    triples (see "Supported message set" below); for unsupported messages
    it counts `skippedUnsupported` and returns `Mono.empty()`. For
    supported messages with missing or blank `data.id` it counts
    `skippedInvalid`, logs at ERROR, and returns `Mono.empty()` without
    synthesizing an id. Otherwise it builds the document and inserts via
    `mongoTemplate.insert(doc, message.collection)`, incrementing
    `materialized` on success, or routing to `handleInsertError` on error.
  - `handleInsertError(...)` — for non-`DuplicateKeyException` errors, logs
    and re-emits the error so the caller can retry the snapshot. For
    duplicate key (matching either `org.springframework.dao.DuplicateKeyException`
    or `com.mongodb.DuplicateKeyException`, including via cause chain), it
    re-fetches the existing document by `_id` and compares payloads
    (excluding `_jt_provenance` on both sides via `Objects.equals`).
    Identical payload → `duplicateMatching++` (idempotent success, no
    overwrite). Differing payload → ERROR log + `conflictingDuplicate++`,
    no overwrite, no abort — the snapshot's later messages still get
    processed. `findById` returning empty after a duplicate-key error
    re-emits the original exception (defensive guard).
  - `buildDocument(docId, snapshot, message)` — `LinkedHashMap` with `_id`
    first, then verbatim `data` fields (so the original `id` is preserved
    alongside `_id` per directive), then `_jt_provenance =
    {txn_id, commit_id, msg_uuid, committed_at, materialized_at}`. The
    reserved key uses an underscore prefix so it cannot collide with a
    schema-valid snake_case payload key.
- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/MaterializeResult.groovy`
  (new) — POGO with public `int` counters: `materialized`,
  `duplicateMatching`, `conflictingDuplicate`, `skippedUnsupported`, and
  `skippedInvalid`. `@ToString(includeNames = true)` for log readability.
- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/TransactionMessagePersistenceService.groovy`
  — added a `CommittedTransactionMaterializer` constructor dependency and a
  single `materializeQuietly(txnId)` post-commit step in `commitHeader`.
  - `commitHeader` first-commit branch: after the existing
    `mongoTemplate.updateFirst(...)` chain, `.then(materializeQuietly(txnId))`
    runs the projection, then `.thenReturn(PersistResult.COMMITTED)` keeps
    the outward result unchanged.
  - `commitHeader` re-delivery branch (`state == 'committed'`): now also
    invokes `materializeQuietly(txnId).thenReturn(PersistResult.COMMIT_DUPLICATE)`
    so a retry can self-heal a projection gap. The directive's "preserve
    outward `PersistResult`" rule is honored: the surface result is still
    `COMMITTED` / `COMMIT_DUPLICATE`.
  - `materializeQuietly(txnId)` — invokes the materializer, logs failures
    at WARN with the `txnId`, swallows the error via `onErrorResume(... ->
    Mono.empty())`, and converts to `Mono<Void>` via `.then()`. Failing the
    commit on a downstream projection error would invert WAL durability
    (the `txn` commit is already durable); the materializer is a
    read-after-commit projection.
  - Open, append, rollback, and validation paths are unchanged. The
    materializer is never invoked on those branches.

### Supported message set

Exactly three message families are materialized in this task. All other
combinations — including update/delete on supported collections, txn-control
actions, and `ppy`/`ent`/`uni`/`grp`/`vdn` messages — are counted as
`skippedUnsupported` and not written.

- `collection == 'loc' && action == 'create'` → insert into `loc`.
- `collection == 'typ' && action == 'create' && data.kind == 'link_type'`
  → insert into `typ`. Bare entity-type `typ` records (e.g. the older
  `04-create-entity-type.json` shape with no `kind`) are intentionally
  skipped here.
- `collection == 'lnk' && action == 'create'` → insert into `lnk`.

### Test coverage

`jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/CommittedTransactionMaterializerSpec.groovy`
(new). Pure Spock with `Mock(ReactiveMongoTemplate)` and
`Mock(CommittedTransactionReadService)`. 19 features:

1. `loc + create` materializes into `loc`, copies `name`/`description`
   verbatim, sets `_id == data.id`, retains the `id` payload field, and
   carries `_jt_provenance` with the snapshot's `txn_id`, `commit_id`,
   `msg_uuid`, `committed_at`, plus a non-null `materialized_at` Instant.
2. Link-type `typ` create materializes into `typ` with all six declarative
   facts and both `allowed_*_collections` values preserved verbatim.
3. `typ + create` without `data.kind == 'link_type'` is **not** written and
   is counted as `skippedUnsupported`.
4. `lnk + create` materializes into `lnk` preserving `type_id`, `left`,
   `right`, and `properties.position` (`kind`, `label`, `row`, `column`).
5. `ppy + create` and `ent + create` are skipped without any insert.
6. `loc + update` is skipped without any insert.
7. Identical-payload duplicate on `loc` (DuplicateKeyException →
   matching existing doc) increments `duplicateMatching`, does not
   `updateFirst` or `save`.
8. Differing-payload duplicate on `loc` (DuplicateKeyException →
   different existing doc) increments `conflictingDuplicate`, does not
   `updateFirst` or `save`.
9. Single conflicting duplicate does not block subsequent messages in the
   same snapshot — a `lnk + create` that follows a conflicting `loc`
   still gets inserted and counted.
10. Missing `data.id` (null) is counted as `skippedInvalid` with no
    insert.
11. Blank/whitespace `data.id` (`''`, `'   '`) is counted as
    `skippedInvalid` with no insert.
12. Mixed-message snapshot (`loc, ppy, typ link-type, ent, lnk`) inserts
    in snapshot order — assertion checks the recorded insert-collection
    sequence equals `['loc', 'typ', 'lnk']` — and produces correct counts
    (`materialized=3, skippedUnsupported=2`).
13. `materialize(txnId)` with non-visible read returns `Mono.empty()`,
    no insert is attempted.
14. `materialize(txnId)` with visible snapshot materializes and increments
    counts.
15. Blank/null/whitespace `txnId` is rejected with
    `IllegalArgumentException` (parameterized over three rows). The call
    is cast to `(String)` to disambiguate from the snapshot overload.
16. `null` snapshot returns `Mono.empty()` without touching
    `mongoTemplate`.

`jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/TransactionMessagePersistenceServiceSpec.groovy`
gained four new features pinning the post-commit hook (and updated the
existing two commit-path features to stub the materializer):

- "post-commit hook invokes materializer exactly once on first successful
  commit" — asserts `1 * materializer.materialize(TXN_ID)` and
  `result == PersistResult.COMMITTED`.
- "post-commit hook also invokes materializer on commit re-delivery to
  fill projection gaps" — asserts `1 * materializer.materialize(TXN_ID)`
  on the `state == 'committed'` branch and `result ==
  PersistResult.COMMIT_DUPLICATE`.
- "materializer failure on the commit path is swallowed and surface
  result is COMMITTED" — `materialize(TXN_ID) >> Mono.error(...)` still
  resolves to `COMMITTED`; `noExceptionThrown()`.
- "materializer failure on commit re-delivery is swallowed and surface
  result is COMMIT_DUPLICATE" — same swallow semantics on the duplicate
  branch.

The constructor change required adding `materializer = Mock(...)` to the
spec's `setup()`. Open / append / rollback / null-message tests are
unchanged because those paths never invoke the materializer.

### Documentation

`docs/architecture/kafka-transaction-message-vocabulary.md` gained a new
"Committed Materialization Of Locations And Links" section after the
"Link Types And Concrete Links" section. The section explains:
- The post-commit projection scope (`loc + create`, link-type `typ +
  create`, `lnk + create`) and what is intentionally not materialized.
- That the `txn` write-ahead log remains the durable, authoritative
  record; the projection is read-after-commit.
- The materialized document shape (`_id == data.id`, verbatim `data` copy,
  reserved `_jt_provenance` sub-document with `txn_id`, `commit_id`,
  `msg_uuid`, `committed_at`, `materialized_at`).
- The duplicate / conflict / missing-id semantics.
- The standing semantic-validation-deferred caveat.

### Out of scope (preserved)

- `libraries/jade-tipi-dto` — no DTO enum, schema, or example change.
- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/kafka/...` — listener,
  topic configuration, deserialization semantics unchanged.
- `CommittedTransactionReadService` and its DTOs
  (`CommittedTransactionSnapshot`, `CommittedTransactionMessage`,
  `KafkaProvenance`) — read-side surface unchanged.
- `MongoDbInitializer` — `loc`, `typ`, `lnk` are already created by the
  enum-driven loop from `TASK-007`; no initializer change needed.
- `application.yml`, `application-test.yml`, `build.gradle`,
  `docker-compose.yml`, `DIRECTION.md`, security/auth code, controllers
  — unchanged.
- No semantic reference validation for `lnk.type_id`, `left`, `right`, or
  `allowed_*_collections`.
- No `parent_location_id` on `loc` records (containment stays canonical
  in `lnk`).
- No update/delete replay, backfill jobs, background workers,
  multi-transaction conflict resolution, plate/well read APIs, "what is
  in this plate?" / "where is this sample?" queries, HTTP submission
  rebuilds, or controllers.
- No integration spec in this task per directive.

### Verification

`docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps` confirmed
`jade-tipi-mongo`, `jade-tipi-kafka`, and `jade-tipi-keycloak` all
healthy. Then:

- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileGroovy` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileTestGroovy` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test --tests '*CommittedTransactionMaterializerSpec*'`
  — BUILD SUCCESSFUL. `tests=19, skipped=0, failures=0, errors=0`.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test --tests '*TransactionMessagePersistenceServiceSpec*'`
  — BUILD SUCCESSFUL. `tests=15, skipped=0, failures=0, errors=0` (was
  11; +4 new post-commit features).
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL. 79 unit tests, 0
  failures, 0 errors:
  - `JadetipiApplicationTests` (1)
  - `TransactionMessageListenerSpec` (4)
  - `DocumentServiceMongoDbImplSpec` (9)
  - `CommittedTransactionReadServiceSpec` (12)
  - `CommittedTransactionReadControllerSpec` (5)
  - `CommittedTransactionMaterializerSpec` (19) — new
  - `TransactionMessagePersistenceServiceSpec` (15) — was 11, +4 new
  - `TransactionServiceSpec` (12)
  - `MongoDbInitializerSpec` (2)
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileIntegrationTestGroovy` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL
  (no integration spec was added in this task).

If a future verification fails because Docker / Mongo is not running,
the documented setup command is `docker compose -f
docker/docker-compose.yml --profile mongodb up -d`; only Mongo is
strictly required for the unit suite because
`JadetipiApplicationTests.contextLoads` opens a Mongo connection.

### Files changed in this turn

- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/CommittedTransactionMaterializer.groovy`
  (new)
- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/MaterializeResult.groovy`
  (new)
- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/TransactionMessagePersistenceService.groovy`
  (added materializer constructor dependency; added
  `materializeQuietly(txnId)` and a single `.then(...)` step on each
  commit branch)
- `jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/CommittedTransactionMaterializerSpec.groovy`
  (new — 19 features)
- `jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/TransactionMessagePersistenceServiceSpec.groovy`
  (added `materializer = Mock(...)`; stubbed materializer in two existing
  commit features; added four new features for the post-commit hook and
  swallow semantics)
- `docs/architecture/kafka-transaction-message-vocabulary.md`
  (new "Committed Materialization Of Locations And Links" section)
- `docs/orchestrator/tasks/TASK-009-committed-location-link-materialization-prework.md`
  (`STATUS` flipped to `READY_FOR_REVIEW`; `LATEST_REPORT` rewritten with
  the implementation outcome and verification result)
- `docs/agents/claude-1-changes.md` — this report.

# Earlier reports

STATUS: READY_FOR_REVIEW
TASK: TASK-008 — Add contents link vocabulary examples
DATE: 2026-05-01
SUMMARY: Added the smallest canonical vocabulary unit for the `contents`
relationship. Two new example messages —
`libraries/jade-tipi-dto/src/main/resources/example/message/11-create-contents-type.json`
(a `typ + create` carrying `data.kind: "link_type"` and the six
declarative facts: `left_role: "container"`, `right_role: "content"`,
`left_to_right_label: "contains"`, `right_to_left_label: "contained_by"`,
`allowed_left_collections: ["loc"]`,
`allowed_right_collections: ["loc", "ent"]`, with ID segment
`~typ~contents`) and
`libraries/jade-tipi-dto/src/main/resources/example/message/12-create-contents-link-plate-sample.json`
(a `lnk + create` referencing that type via `type_id` and pointing
`left` at a plate `~loc~plate_b1` and `right` at a sample `~ent~sample_x1`
with a snake-case `properties.position` of
`{kind: "plate_well", label: "A1", row: "A", column: 1}`). Both examples
reuse the established canonical batch `txn.uuid`
`018fd849-2a40-7abc-8a45-111111111111` and use the three-letter ID
segments `~typ~`, `~lnk~`, `~loc~`, `~ent~` per `DIRECTION.md`; the
older `04-create-entity-type.json` `~ty~` example is intentionally left
untouched per the director directive. `MessageSpec` got both new paths
appended to `EXAMPLE_PATHS` so the existing `@Unroll` round-trip and
schema-validate features cover them, plus two focused features pinning
the canonical shapes — one asserts the `contents` `typ` declaration's
collection/action and all six declarative facts, and one asserts the
`contents` `lnk` envelope's collection/action, the `~typ~contents` /
`~loc~plate_b1` / `~ent~sample_x1` reference suffixes, and the
`position.kind/label/row/column` values. `docs/architecture/kafka-transaction-message-vocabulary.md`
gained a new "Link Types And Concrete Links" section after the property
assignment section that explains containment is canonical in `lnk`,
that link-type semantics live in `typ` (with `data.kind: "link_type"`
mirroring the `ppy` `definition`/`assignment` discriminator pattern),
that `loc` records still do not carry parentage, and that semantic
reference validation (type/endpoint resolution and
`allowed_*_collections` matching) is not enforced today and is a
follow-up reader/materializer concern. The numbered reference-examples
list was extended to `11-create-contents-type.json` and
`12-create-contents-link-plate-sample.json`. `docs/Jade-Tipi.md`,
`DIRECTION.md`, and the JSON schema are unchanged. No DTO enum, schema,
backend service/listener/controller/initializer, build, Docker Compose,
security policy, HTTP wrapper, materializer, semantic-validation,
plate/well read API, `parent_location_id`, or committed-snapshot change.
VERIFICATION: `./gradlew :libraries:jade-tipi-dto:test` passed
(`MessageSpec` `tests=39, failures=0, errors=0`; `UnitSpec`
`tests=8, failures=0, errors=0`); the two new examples flow through
the existing round-trip and schema-validate `@Unroll` features (12
round-trip features and 12 schema-validate features cover examples
01–12), and the two new focused features for the `contents`
declaration and concrete link both pass.

## TASK-008 — Add contents link vocabulary examples

Director moved `TASK-008` to `READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION` on 2026-05-01
with implementation directives in
`docs/orchestrator/tasks/TASK-008-contents-link-vocabulary-examples.md`
and the `TASK-008 Director Pre-work Review` block in
`DIRECTIVES.md`. Implementation done on 2026-05-01.

### Example resource changes

- `libraries/jade-tipi-dto/src/main/resources/example/message/11-create-contents-type.json`
  (new) — canonical `typ + create` envelope declaring the `contents`
  link type. Reuses the canonical batch `txn.uuid`
  `018fd849-2a40-7abc-8a45-111111111111`. The `data` payload carries
  `kind: "link_type"` (mirroring the `ppy` `kind` discriminator
  pattern), the canonical ID
  `jade-tipi-org~dev~018fd849-2a49-7999-8a09-aaaaaaaaaaab~typ~contents`,
  human description, and the six declarative facts:
  `left_role: "container"`, `right_role: "content"`,
  `left_to_right_label: "contains"`,
  `right_to_left_label: "contained_by"`,
  `allowed_left_collections: ["loc"]`,
  `allowed_right_collections: ["loc", "ent"]`. All field names are
  snake_case-compliant for the schema's nested
  `propertyNames` rule.
- `libraries/jade-tipi-dto/src/main/resources/example/message/12-create-contents-link-plate-sample.json`
  (new) — canonical `lnk + create` envelope for a concrete plate-well
  containment. Reuses the same canonical batch `txn.uuid` as the
  `typ` example. The `data` payload carries `id` ending in
  `~lnk~plate_b1_sample_x1`, `type_id` pointing at the
  `~typ~contents` ID from the type example, `left` pointing at a
  plate `~loc~plate_b1` and `right` pointing at a sample
  `~ent~sample_x1` (both endpoints are flat string IDs that are not
  themselves created by example messages — semantic reference
  validation is `OUT_OF_SCOPE`), and a `properties.position` object
  `{kind: "plate_well", label: "A1", row: "A", column: 1}`. The
  `"A1"` / `"A"` casing matches `DIRECTION.md` per the director's
  pre-work review (the snake_case rule applies to property names,
  not values).

### MessageSpec coverage

`libraries/jade-tipi-dto/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/dto/message/MessageSpec.groovy`:

- Appended `/example/message/11-create-contents-type.json` and
  `/example/message/12-create-contents-link-plate-sample.json` to
  `EXAMPLE_PATHS`, so the existing `@Unroll` features
  `"example #examplePath round-trips through JsonMapper preserving collection"`
  and `"example #examplePath validates against the schema"` now cover
  examples 01 through 12 (24 generated features in total for those
  two `@Unroll` features).
- Added focused feature
  `"contents typ example declares the canonical link-type facts"`:
  asserts `Collection.TYPE`, `Action.CREATE`, the canonical
  `~typ~contents` ID, `data.kind == 'link_type'`,
  `data.name == 'contents'`, `data.left_role == 'container'`,
  `data.right_role == 'content'`,
  `data.left_to_right_label == 'contains'`,
  `data.right_to_left_label == 'contained_by'`,
  `data.allowed_left_collections == ['loc']`, and
  `data.allowed_right_collections == ['loc', 'ent']`. This pins the
  canonical declaration so a later refactor of the example file fails
  loudly rather than silently dropping a fact.
- Added focused feature
  `"contents lnk example references the contents type and carries a position property"`:
  asserts `Collection.LINK`, `Action.CREATE`, `data.id` ending with
  `~lnk~plate_b1_sample_x1`, `data.type_id` ending with
  `~typ~contents`, `data.left` ending with `~loc~plate_b1`,
  `data.right` ending with `~ent~sample_x1`, and the
  `properties.position` object's `kind`, `label`, `row`, and `column`
  values. This pins the canonical concrete-link shape and the
  `DIRECTION.md` plate-well coordinate casing.

No new spec file was added, no schema-rejection feature was added
(the directive's task is to add canonical examples; existing
`Collection.PROPERTY + Action.OPEN` and `LOCATION` rejection features
already establish the rejection-pattern coverage), and no test was
removed.

### Documentation changes

`docs/architecture/kafka-transaction-message-vocabulary.md`:

- Added new section "Link Types And Concrete Links" after the
  "Property Value Assignment" section. The section records that
  containment lives in `lnk` (not on `loc.parent_location_id`),
  that link semantics live in `typ` as `link_type` declarations
  (mirroring the `ppy` `definition`/`assignment` discriminator),
  and that the first canonical link type is `contents`. It shows
  the canonical `typ` payload shape (snake-case `data` body) and
  the canonical `lnk` payload shape (`type_id`, `left`, `right`,
  `properties.position`) as JSON snippets in the same style used
  for property and entity sections. It explicitly notes that
  semantic reference validation (`type_id` resolution, `left` /
  `right` resolution, and matching `allowed_*_collections`) is
  not enforced today and is a follow-up reader/materializer
  concern, and that property-name values such as `"A1"` are stored
  verbatim because the snake_case rule constrains property keys,
  not values.
- Extended the numbered "Reference Examples" list with
  `11. 11-create-contents-type.json` and
  `12. 12-create-contents-link-plate-sample.json`.

`docs/Jade-Tipi.md` is unchanged — the high-level spec already covers
links and types generically and a `contents`-specific paragraph would
duplicate the architecture doc. `DIRECTION.md` is unchanged — it
already records the `contents` direction.

### Out of scope (preserved)

- `libraries/jade-tipi-dto/src/main/java/org/jadetipi/dto/message/Collection.java`,
  `Action.java`, and `Message.java` — unchanged. `LINK` and `TYPE`
  already exist with the correct data-action whitelist.
- `libraries/jade-tipi-dto/src/main/resources/schema/message.schema.json` —
  unchanged. The schema already accepts `lnk + create` and
  `typ + create`; every field name in the new examples is
  snake_case-compliant for the recursive `propertyNames` rule.
- `04-create-entity-type.json` — left untouched per the director
  directive. The older two-letter `~ty~` segment is preserved; the
  new `~typ~` segment establishes the canonical link-type ID form
  going forward without a backward-incompatible rewrite.
- All backend code under `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/...`
  (Kafka listener, persistence service, committed read service,
  controller, `MongoDbInitializer`, security config). The
  `Collection.values()` startup loop already handles `lnk` and
  `typ`.
- All build files (`build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`,
  `gradle.properties`), `application.yml` profiles, Docker Compose,
  and security policy.
- HTTP submission wrappers, materializers, semantic reference
  validation, plate/well read APIs, and the committed-snapshot
  surface (`CommittedTransactionReadService` /
  `CommittedTransactionReadController`).
- `parent_location_id` is not added to `loc` records; containment
  remains canonical in `lnk` per `DIRECTION.md`.
- The `txn` write-ahead log record shape from `TASK-003` is
  preserved.

### Verification

`./gradlew :libraries:jade-tipi-dto:test --rerun-tasks` —
**BUILD SUCCESSFUL**. The XML report shows
`MessageSpec` `tests=39, failures=0, errors=0, skipped=0` and
`UnitSpec` `tests=8, failures=0, errors=0, skipped=0`. The two new
focused features
(`contents typ example declares the canonical link-type facts` and
`contents lnk example references the contents type and carries a
position property`) and the two new `@Unroll`-generated rows for
each of the round-trip and schema-validate `@Unroll` features all
pass.

`./gradlew :libraries:jade-tipi-dto:compileJava` ran as part of the
test task (`compileJava` was up-to-date / executed with the
re-run; no Java source was changed and compilation succeeded).

No further regression commands were needed for `TASK-008` — there is
no Kafka, HTTP, listener, persistence, controller, initializer, or
materializer change. `:jade-tipi:test` and `:jade-tipi:integrationTest`
were not required by the task directive and were not run.

STATUS: READY_FOR_REVIEW
TASK: TASK-007 — Add location collection
DATE: 2026-05-01
SUMMARY: Added `loc` as a first-class long-term Jade-Tipi collection.
`Collection.LOCATION("location","loc")` was added to the DTO enum and
inherits the data-action set automatically; `message.schema.json` now
admits `"loc"` in the top-level collection enum and in the
non-transaction action-compatibility conditional, so `loc` accepts
`create|update|delete` and rejects `open|commit|rollback`. A canonical
`10-create-location.json` example was added with the `~loc~` ID suffix
per the director directive. `MessageSpec` was extended with enum
round-trip, schema-acceptance for `loc + create`, and `@Unroll`
schema-rejection for each transaction-control action paired with `loc`;
the new example was added to `EXAMPLE_PATHS` so the existing round-trip
and schema-validate features cover it. A new pure-Spock backend spec
`MongoDbInitializerSpec` proves the existing `Collection.values()` loop
in `MongoDbInitializer` calls `createCollection('loc')` exactly once when
`loc` is missing and not at all when `loc` already exists; no change to
`MongoDbInitializer.groovy`. Docs updated: `docs/Jade-Tipi.md` lists
`location (loc)` and clarifies `txn` as the special log/staging
collection, and `docs/architecture/kafka-transaction-message-vocabulary.md`
adds `loc` to the prose enumeration, the action-compatibility bullet, and
the numbered reference-examples list. `DIRECTION.md` is unchanged per
directive. No production code change in `MongoDbInitializer.groovy`,
`TransactionMessagePersistenceService`, `TransactionMessageListener`,
`CommittedTransactionReadService`, `CommittedTransactionReadController`,
`SecurityConfig`, `application.yml`, or `build.gradle`. The `txn`
write-ahead log shape from TASK-003 is preserved.
VERIFICATION: docker compose stack healthy (`jade-tipi-mongo`,
`jade-tipi-kafka`, `jade-tipi-keycloak`). `./gradlew
:libraries:jade-tipi-dto:test` (`MessageSpec` `tests=33, failures=0`),
`./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileGroovy`,
`./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileTestGroovy`,
`./gradlew :jade-tipi:test --tests '*MongoDbInitializerSpec*'`
(`tests=2, failures=0`), and `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test` (56 unit tests,
0 failures, 0 errors) all passed.

## TASK-007 — Add location collection

Director moved `TASK-007` to `READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION` on 2026-05-01 with
the implementation directives in
`docs/orchestrator/tasks/TASK-007-add-location-collection.md`.
Implementation done on 2026-05-01.

### DTO changes

- `libraries/jade-tipi-dto/src/main/java/org/jadetipi/dto/message/Collection.java`
  now declares `LOCATION("location", "loc")` between `LINK` and `UNIT`.
  The existing constructor branch on `"transaction".equals(name)` gives
  `LOCATION` the data-mutating action set `[CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE]`
  automatically; `fromJson(String)` and `@JsonValue` already handle the
  new value through the abbreviation/name match path.
- `libraries/jade-tipi-dto/src/main/resources/schema/message.schema.json`
  has `"loc"` in `$defs/Collection.enum` (between `"lnk"` and `"ppy"`)
  and in the long-term-collection enum inside the second `allOf`
  conditional. The first conditional (transaction-only actions for
  `txn`) is unchanged, so `loc` paired with `open|commit|rollback`
  fails the second conditional's `action ∈ {create, update, delete}`
  whitelist.
- New canonical example
  `libraries/jade-tipi-dto/src/main/resources/example/message/10-create-location.json`
  is a `loc + create` envelope with `id` suffix `~loc~freezer_a` (per the
  director directive to use `loc` consistently in example IDs rather than
  introducing a separate `lo` suffix in this task).

### DTO test coverage

`libraries/jade-tipi-dto/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/dto/message/MessageSpec.groovy`:

- Added `/example/message/10-create-location.json` to `EXAMPLE_PATHS`,
  so the existing `@Unroll` round-trip and `validate()` features
  automatically cover the `loc` example.
- Added `Collection.fromJson('loc')` enum-shape feature: asserts
  `fromJson('loc') == LOCATION`, `fromJson('location') == LOCATION`,
  `LOCATION.toJson() == 'loc'`, `LOCATION.abbreviation == 'loc'`,
  `LOCATION.name == 'location'`, and `LOCATION.actions == [CREATE,
  UPDATE, DELETE]`.
- Added `loc + create` schema acceptance feature using
  `Message.newInstance(...)` and `validate()` with `noExceptionThrown()`.
- Added an `@Unroll` schema-rejection feature over the three
  transaction-control actions (`OPEN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) paired
  with `Collection.LOCATION`, asserting `ValidationException` whose
  message contains "action".

`MessageSpec` totals after the change: `tests=33, skipped=0,
failures=0, errors=0` (was 23; +10 = 1 enum-shape + 1 schema-accept +
3 schema-reject @Unroll rows + 2 round-trip + 2 validate from the new
example + 1 added by parameter expansion).

### Backend startup coverage

New `jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/mongo/config/MongoDbInitializerSpec.groovy`
(pure Spock, no Spring context, no live Mongo). Uses `Mock(ReactiveMongoTemplate)`:

1. **`run()` creates the `loc` collection when it does not yet exist.**
   Asserts `1 * collectionExists('loc') >> Mono.just(false)`,
   `1 * createCollection('loc') >> Mono.empty()`,
   `0 * createCollection({ String name -> name != 'loc' })`, and uses
   wildcard catch-alls (`_ * collectionExists(_) >> Mono.just(true)`,
   `_ * getCollection(_) >> Mono.empty()`) for every other collection.
   The system-out shows the existing initializer log line
   `"Creating collection 'loc'"` for each of the eight non-`loc` enum
   values plus `tipi`, while only `loc` reaches `createCollection`.
2. **`run()` does not recreate `loc` when it already exists.**
   Asserts `0 * createCollection(_ as String)` and stubs every existence
   check as `Mono.just(true)`.

`MongoDbInitializer.groovy` is intentionally unchanged. The behavior is
gained for free via `Collection.values()` once `LOCATION` is in the
enum.

### Documentation

- `docs/Jade-Tipi.md` — added `* location     (loc)` between
  `link (lnk)` and `unit (uni)` in the abbreviation list, and a short
  note clarifying that `txn` is the durable transaction log/staging
  collection while the other abbreviations name long-term materialized
  domain collections.
- `docs/architecture/kafka-transaction-message-vocabulary.md` — added
  `loc` to the prose collection enumeration, to the
  long-term-collection bullet (`collection ∈ {ent, ppy, lnk, loc, uni,
  grp, typ, vdn} → action ∈ {create, update, delete}`), and added
  `10. 10-create-location.json` to the numbered reference-examples
  list.
- `DIRECTION.md` is unchanged. The document is already aligned with
  this task's scope (location/link modeling, no `parent_location_id`
  on `loc`, future `contents` link type) and no implementation detail
  contradicted it.

### Files changed in this turn

- `libraries/jade-tipi-dto/src/main/java/org/jadetipi/dto/message/Collection.java`
- `libraries/jade-tipi-dto/src/main/resources/schema/message.schema.json`
- `libraries/jade-tipi-dto/src/main/resources/example/message/10-create-location.json`
  (new)
- `libraries/jade-tipi-dto/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/dto/message/MessageSpec.groovy`
- `jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/mongo/config/MongoDbInitializerSpec.groovy`
  (new)
- `docs/Jade-Tipi.md`
- `docs/architecture/kafka-transaction-message-vocabulary.md`
- `docs/orchestrator/tasks/TASK-007-add-location-collection.md`
  (`STATUS` flipped from `READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION` to
  `READY_FOR_REVIEW`; `LATEST_REPORT` rewritten with the
  implementation outcome)
- `docs/agents/claude-1-changes.md` — this report.

### What did not change

- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/mongo/config/MongoDbInitializer.groovy`
  (no source change required; the new collection is created via the
  existing `Collection.values()` loop).
- `TransactionMessageListener`, `TransactionMessagePersistenceService`,
  `TransactionService`, `CommittedTransactionReadService`,
  `CommittedTransactionReadController`, `GlobalExceptionHandler`,
  `ErrorResponse`, `SecurityConfig`, `application.yml`,
  `application-test.yml`, `build.gradle`, and the `txn` write-ahead log
  shape from `TASK-003` / `TASK-004` are unchanged.
- No new authentication, authorization, redaction, materialization,
  link-type, plate/well, or HTTP-submission policy was added.
- No `DIRECTION.md` change.

### Verification

`docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps` showed `jade-tipi-mongo`,
`jade-tipi-kafka`, and `jade-tipi-keycloak` all healthy. Then:

- `./gradlew :libraries:jade-tipi-dto:test` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
  `MessageSpec` `tests=33, skipped=0, failures=0, errors=0`.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileGroovy` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileTestGroovy` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test --tests '*MongoDbInitializerSpec*'` —
  BUILD SUCCESSFUL. `tests=2, skipped=0, failures=0, errors=0`.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL. 56 unit tests across:
  - `JadetipiApplicationTests` (1)
  - `TransactionMessageListenerSpec` (4)
  - `DocumentServiceMongoDbImplSpec` (9)
  - `CommittedTransactionReadServiceSpec` (12)
  - `CommittedTransactionReadControllerSpec` (5)
  - `TransactionMessagePersistenceServiceSpec` (11)
  - `TransactionServiceSpec` (12)
  - `MongoDbInitializerSpec` (2) — new
  All green; `failures=0, errors=0`.

If a future verification fails because Docker / Mongo is not running,
the documented setup command is `docker compose -f
docker/docker-compose.yml --profile mongodb up -d` (only Mongo is
strictly required for the unit suite because
`JadetipiApplicationTests.contextLoads` opens a Mongo connection).

STATUS: READY_FOR_REVIEW

## TASK-006 — Add committed transaction snapshot HTTP read adapter

Director moved `TASK-006` to `READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION` on 2026-04-30 with
the implementation directives in
`docs/orchestrator/tasks/TASK-006-committed-transaction-snapshot-http-read-adapter.md`
(route `GET /api/transactions/{id}/snapshot`, return the existing
`CommittedTransactionSnapshot` service-boundary object directly with
default Jackson camelCase, delegate committed visibility entirely to
`CommittedTransactionReadService.findCommitted`, map empty service result
to HTTP 404 with no body, let blank/whitespace ids fall through the
service `Assert.hasText` to the `GlobalExceptionHandler` 400 path, mirror
existing controller/security patterns, and add narrow `WebTestClient`
controller coverage). Implementation done on 2026-04-30.

### Production change

- New `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/controller/CommittedTransactionReadController.groovy`.
  - `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping('/api/transactions')`, `@Slf4j`.
  - One method: `Mono<ResponseEntity<CommittedTransactionSnapshot>>
    getSnapshot(@PathVariable('id') String id, @AuthenticationPrincipal Jwt jwt)`
    on `@GetMapping('/{id}/snapshot')`.
  - Body is literally `readService.findCommitted(id) ...
    .map { snapshot -> ResponseEntity.ok(snapshot) }
    .defaultIfEmpty(ResponseEntity.notFound().build())`. No duplicated
    WAL gate, no inline blank-id check, no per-id authorization, no
    redaction, no pagination, no list endpoint, no Mongo collaborator.
  - Logs only the `id` and the message count.

### What did not change

- `CommittedTransactionReadService`, `CommittedTransactionSnapshot`,
  `CommittedTransactionMessage`, and `KafkaProvenance` are unchanged
  (no fields, annotations, or package moves). Per the TASK-005
  director decision the snapshot value objects stay in `service/`;
  this task did not relocate them to `dto/` or add snake_case
  annotations.
- `TransactionController`, `DocumentController`, `TransactionService`,
  `TransactionMessagePersistenceService`,
  `TransactionMessageListener`, `GlobalExceptionHandler`,
  `ErrorResponse`, `SecurityConfig`, `application.yml`,
  `build.gradle`, and the `txn` write-ahead log shape from TASK-003
  are unchanged.
- No new authentication, authorization, redaction, pagination, list,
  or bulk policy was added.

### New test coverage

New `jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/controller/CommittedTransactionReadControllerSpec.groovy`.

- Pattern: `WebTestClient.bindToController(controller)` (no Spring
  context, no Mongo/Kafka/Keycloak), wired with the real
  `GlobalExceptionHandler` via `.controllerAdvice(...)` and a
  registered `AuthenticationPrincipalArgumentResolver` so the
  `@AuthenticationPrincipal Jwt jwt` parameter resolves to `null`
  without a security context. The
  `CommittedTransactionReadService` collaborator is `Mock(...)`-ed.
- Five Spock features, all green:
  1. Committed snapshot returns 200 with the JSON body (`txnId`,
     `commitId`, `state`, `openData.hint`, `commitData.reason`,
     `messages.length()=2`, and the first message's `msgUuid`,
     `collection`, `action`, `data.name`, `kafka.topic`,
     `kafka.partition`, `kafka.offset`, `kafka.timestampMs`) plus the
     ordering of the second message's `msgUuid`, exercising the
     actual route and Jackson serialization (incl. `Instant` round-trip
     via `JavaTimeModule`).
  2. Controller delegates exclusively to
     `CommittedTransactionReadService` for committed lookups
     (`1 * readService.findCommitted(TXN_ID) >> Mono.just(...)`,
     `0 * _`).
  3. Missing or non-committed service result returns HTTP 404 with an
     empty body (`expectBody().isEmpty()`).
  4. Whitespace-only id surfaces the service's `Assert.hasText`
     `IllegalArgumentException` as the standard 400 `ErrorResponse`
     through `GlobalExceptionHandler` (`status=400`,
     `error='Bad Request'`, `message='txnId must not be blank'`).
  5. The controller's only constructor argument is
     `CommittedTransactionReadService`, proving no direct Mongo
     collaborator at the type level.

### Verification

`docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps` showed mongodb, kafka,
and keycloak healthy. Then:

- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileGroovy` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileTestGroovy` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test --tests '*CommittedTransactionReadControllerSpec*'`
  — 5/5 features green (`tests=5 failures=0 errors=0` in the JUnit XML).
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test` — full unit suite green; aggregated 54
  tests across all `:jade-tipi` specs, 0 failures, 0 errors.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileIntegrationTestGroovy` — BUILD
  SUCCESSFUL (no integration spec was added in this task).

### Files changed in this turn

- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/controller/CommittedTransactionReadController.groovy`
  — new file, the WebFlux read adapter described above.
- `jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/controller/CommittedTransactionReadControllerSpec.groovy`
  — new file, the controller-level Spock spec described above.
- `docs/orchestrator/tasks/TASK-006-committed-transaction-snapshot-http-read-adapter.md`
  — STATUS flipped from `READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION` to `READY_FOR_REVIEW`,
  `LATEST_REPORT` rewritten to record the implementation outcome.
- `docs/agents/claude-1-changes.md` — this report.

STATUS: READY_FOR_REVIEW

## TASK-005 — Director-review fix: coerce raw Mongo timestamps to Instant

Director implementation review on 2026-04-30 returned `TASK-005` to
`READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION` with one blocking finding:
`CommittedTransactionReadService` cast raw Mongo `Map` timestamp fields
directly to `Instant`, but BSON dates read into raw maps may surface as
`java.util.Date`, so a real committed snapshot could fail with
`GroovyCastException` even though the mocked unit tests passed by
injecting `Instant` fixtures.

Resolved on 2026-04-30. `TASK-005` flipped back to `READY_FOR_REVIEW`.

### Fix

- `CommittedTransactionReadService` now routes header `opened_at`,
  header `committed_at`, and message `received_at` through a new
  `private static Instant toInstant(Object)` helper.
- The helper accepts `null` (returns `null`), `Instant` (returned as-is),
  and `java.util.Date` (`.toInstant()`); any other type raises
  `IllegalStateException` so a future schema change cannot silently
  degrade timestamps to `null`.
- The `_id` ASC sort, the committed-visibility gate (`record_type =
  transaction` + `state = committed` + non-blank `commit_id`), and the
  short-circuit on missing/open/old-shape headers are unchanged.
- No write-side change. `TransactionMessagePersistenceService` continues
  to set `Instant` values; the read service now tolerates whichever
  representation the Mongo driver surfaces when documents round-trip
  through a raw `Map`.

### New unit coverage

- New feature in `CommittedTransactionReadServiceSpec`:
  `'java.util.Date timestamps from raw Mongo documents are coerced to
  Instant'`. Seeds the header with `Date.from(Instant.parse(...))` for
  `opened_at` and `committed_at` and the message row with `Date.from(...)`
  for `received_at`, then asserts that `snapshot.openedAt`,
  `snapshot.committedAt`, and `snapshot.messages[0].receivedAt` are all
  `instanceof Instant` and equal the original `Instant` values.
- All previously-required features are retained: committed snapshot
  returns header + messages, open/uncommitted is hidden, missing or
  blank `commit_id` partial-write is hidden, missing header returns
  empty, older `TransactionService`-shape (no `record_type`) is
  hidden, blank/null/whitespace `txnId` raises
  `IllegalArgumentException`, null payload fields are tolerated, and
  the Mongo query is asserted to carry `Sort.by(ASC, '_id')` (proves
  the database is doing the sort).

### Files changed in this turn

- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/CommittedTransactionReadService.groovy`
  — added `import java.util.Date`, added `private static Instant
  toInstant(Object)`, and switched the three timestamp reads to use it.
- `jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/CommittedTransactionReadServiceSpec.groovy`
  — added the `Date`-coercion feature.
- `docs/orchestrator/tasks/TASK-005-committed-transaction-snapshot-read-layer.md`
  — `STATUS` flipped to `READY_FOR_REVIEW`; `LATEST_REPORT` rewritten
  for the re-submission.

No write-side persistence, controller, DTO-package, integration-test,
build, or resource files changed. The `txn` write-ahead log shape from
`TASK-003` is preserved.

### Verification

Setup (project-documented; already up locally): `docker compose -f
docker/docker-compose.yml up -d`. Containers verified up:
`jade-tipi-mongo`, `jade-tipi-kafka`, `jade-tipi-keycloak`.

- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test --tests
  '*CommittedTransactionReadServiceSpec*'` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
  Spec report: `tests=12, skipped=0, failures=0, errors=0` (was 11; +1
  new Date-coercion feature).
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL. 49 unit tests across:
  - `JadetipiApplicationTests` (1)
  - `TransactionMessageListenerSpec` (4)
  - `DocumentServiceMongoDbImplSpec` (9)
  - `CommittedTransactionReadServiceSpec` (12) — was 11
  - `TransactionMessagePersistenceServiceSpec` (11)
  - `TransactionServiceSpec` (12)

If a future verification fails because Docker / Mongo is not running,
the documented setup command is `docker compose -f
docker/docker-compose.yml up -d` (only Mongo is strictly required for
the unit suite because `JadetipiApplicationTests.contextLoads` opens a
Mongo connection).

## TASK-005 — Add committed transaction snapshot read layer

Goal completed. The backend now has a Kafka-free and HTTP-free read-side
layer over the accepted `txn` write-ahead log (TASK-003 / TASK-004) that
returns a single committed transaction snapshot (header + staged messages)
without materializing into long-term collections. The transaction header
remains the authoritative committed-visibility marker; child message
stamping is still not required.

Task lifecycle: `TASK-005` flipped to `READY_FOR_REVIEW` per directive
(no `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE` status used).

### As-built decisions (per pre-work + director directives)

- **Service boundary.** New `service/CommittedTransactionReadService` is a
  Kafka-free / HTTP-free `@Service` with one public method:
  `Mono<CommittedTransactionSnapshot> findCommitted(String txnId)`. It uses
  `ReactiveMongoTemplate` directly (no new dependency) and reuses the
  field-name and state constants exposed on
  `TransactionMessagePersistenceService` so the read and write shapes stay
  in lock-step.
- **No controller.** Per directive, no controller was added for TASK-005;
  service-level coverage is sufficient. A later HTTP task can wrap this
  service into a thin adapter.
- **Committed-visibility gate.** The service emits `Mono.empty()` unless
  the header has `record_type='transaction'`, `state='committed'`, and a
  non-blank `commit_id`. This rejects:
  - missing headers (no document at `_id == txnId`),
  - open / uncommitted headers,
  - committed-but-no-`commit_id` partial-write states (defense in depth;
    today's writer always sets both atomically),
  - the older `TransactionService` document shape (which has no
    `record_type`) coexisting in the same `txn` collection.
  In each rejected case the message-record lookup is short-circuited.
- **Snapshot DTO location.** Per directive, snapshot return classes live
  under `org.jadetipi.jadetipi.service`, not `dto/`. They are internal
  service-boundary types, not HTTP request/response DTOs:
  - `service/CommittedTransactionSnapshot` (`txnId`, `state`, `commitId`,
    `openedAt`, `committedAt`, `openData`, `commitData`, `messages`).
  - `service/CommittedTransactionMessage` (`msgUuid`, `collection`,
    `action`, `data`, `receivedAt`, `kafka`).
- **Read-side Kafka provenance.** Per directive, a service-local
  `service/KafkaProvenance` value object is used instead of reusing the
  write-side `kafka.KafkaSourceMetadata`. Same fields (`topic`,
  `partition`, `offset`, `timestampMs`) but the read service does not
  import the `kafka` package.
- **Deterministic message ordering.** The Mongo query for messages is
  `Criteria.where('record_type').is('message').and('txn_id').is(txnId)`
  with `Sort.by(ASC, '_id')`. Because `_id = txn_id~msg_uuid` and `txn_id`
  is constant within a result set, this collapses to ordered-by-`msg_uuid`
  and uses the implicit `_id` index. The unit spec asserts the issued
  `Query.sortObject == new Document('_id', 1)` per directive (proves the
  database is doing the sort) and verifies the snapshot preserves the
  Mongo-returned order regardless of the mocked `Flux` order.
- **Input validation.** `Assert.hasText` on `txnId` matches the existing
  `TransactionService` convention; blank/null/whitespace inputs raise
  `IllegalArgumentException` and never call Mongo.
- **Null tolerance.** Header timestamps, `open_data`, `commit_data`,
  message `data`, `received_at`, and the `kafka` sub-doc may all be
  absent on real records; the snapshot returns them as `null` without
  NPE.
- **No production-code change to existing files.**
  `TransactionMessagePersistenceService` (writer),
  `TransactionMessageListener`, `TransactionService`, controllers,
  `application.yml`, and `build.gradle` are unchanged. The directive
  required preserving the `TASK-003` write-ahead log shape.

### Files added

- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/CommittedTransactionReadService.groovy`
- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/CommittedTransactionSnapshot.groovy`
- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/CommittedTransactionMessage.groovy`
- `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/KafkaProvenance.groovy`
- `jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/CommittedTransactionReadServiceSpec.groovy`
  (8 features, 11 test rows once the data-driven `where:` block is
  expanded for blank/null/whitespace `txnId`).

### Files updated (in scope)

- `docs/orchestrator/tasks/TASK-005-committed-transaction-snapshot-read-layer.md`
  — `STATUS` flipped to `READY_FOR_REVIEW`; `LATEST_REPORT` updated with
  the as-built shape and verification.

### Verification

Setup (project-documented):

- `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d` — Mongo + Kafka +
  Keycloak. Verified containers were already healthy from prior work
  (`jade-tipi-mongo`, `jade-tipi-kafka`, `jade-tipi-keycloak`).

Compilation:

- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileGroovy` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileTestGroovy` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileIntegrationTestGroovy` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL
  (cross-source-set sanity check; no integration spec added or required).

Targeted unit run:

- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test --tests '*CommittedTransactionReadServiceSpec*'`
  — BUILD SUCCESSFUL. New spec: `tests=11, skipped=0, failures=0,
  errors=0`.

Regression check on the full unit suite:

- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Now 48 tests pass:
  - `JadetipiApplicationTests` (1)
  - `TransactionMessageListenerSpec` (4)
  - `DocumentServiceMongoDbImplSpec` (9)
  - `CommittedTransactionReadServiceSpec` (11) — new
  - `TransactionMessagePersistenceServiceSpec` (11)
  - `TransactionServiceSpec` (12)

No integration spec is added for TASK-005. The TASK-004 integration spec
already proves the Kafka writer path produces the documents this read
service projects, and the read service has no Kafka or HTTP dependency
of its own.

### Out-of-scope items not implemented (per directive)

- No materialization into `ent`, `ppy`, `typ`, `lnk`, or other long-term
  collections.
- No semantic reference validation between properties / types / entities /
  assignments.
- No HTTP submission wrapper or read controller; service-level coverage
  is sufficient for `TASK-005`.
- No change to Kafka ingestion, topic configuration, or message envelope
  semantics. The `txn` write-ahead log shape from `TASK-003` is preserved.
- No new auth/authz policy.

## TASK-004 — Add Kafka transaction ingest integration coverage

Goal completed. The backend Kafka ingestion path now has an end-to-end
integration spec that publishes canonical `Message` records (open + data
+ commit) to a per-spec Kafka topic and asserts the resulting `txn`
header and message documents in MongoDB. The spec is opt-in: it skips
unless `JADETIPI_IT_KAFKA=1` is set and a 2-second `AdminClient` broker
probe to `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` (default `localhost:9092`) succeeds.

### As-built decisions (per pre-work)

- **Topic strategy.** Per-test topic `jdtp-txn-itest-${shortUuid}`
  created via Kafka `AdminClient.createTopics` in a static
  `@DynamicPropertySource` method (so the topic exists before the
  Spring listener container starts). Deleted in `cleanupSpec` via
  `AdminClient.deleteTopics`. Failed delete is logged but tolerated —
  each run picks a fresh `shortUuid` so leftovers do not interfere.
- **Listener subscription.** The spec sets
  `jadetipi.kafka.txn-topic-pattern` to a regex matching only its
  per-run topic, so the listener does not pick up records from
  `jdtp_cli_kli` or other developers' topics. The default production
  pattern is unchanged.
- **Test gating.** Spock `@IgnoreIf` runs before the Spring context
  loads. Without the env flag or with no broker reachable, the spec
  cleanly reports `skipped=2` and does not start the Spring context.
- **Consumer-group strategy.** A per-run unique
  `spring.kafka.consumer.group-id` (`jadetipi-itest-${shortUuid}`)
  combined with `auto-offset-reset=earliest` (already the production
  default) gives every run a deterministic offset-0 start.
- **Topic discovery latency.**
  `spring.kafka.consumer.properties.metadata.max.age.ms` is shortened
  to `2000` for this spec, so the pattern subscription notices the
  pre-created test topic within ~2s instead of the 5-minute Kafka
  default.
- **Producer wiring.** Plain `KafkaProducer<String, byte[]>` (acks=all)
  serializing each `Message` with the project's
  `org.jadetipi.dto.util.JsonMapper.toBytes(...)`. No new dependency.
  Records are keyed by `txnId` so they hash to the single test-topic
  partition, preserving open → data → commit order.
- **Wait strategy.** Inline reactive polling helpers
  (`awaitMongo` / `awaitConditionTrue`) with a 30s ceiling and 250ms
  cadence. No `org.awaitility:awaitility` dependency added.
- **Cleanup scope.** Per-feature: `mongoTemplate.remove(...)` keyed by
  `txn_id` so the spec coexists with `TransactionServiceIntegrationSpec`,
  which writes its own (different-shape) documents to `txn`. Per-spec:
  delete the test topic.
- **Number of features.** Two:
  1. **Happy path.** Publish open + data + commit, assert the header
     reaches `state=committed` with a backend `commit_id`, and assert
     the data message document has `_id = txnId~msgUuid`,
     `record_type=message`, `collection=ppy`, `kafka.topic`,
     `kafka.partition`, `kafka.offset`, and `kafka.timestamp_ms`.
     Verify `count(txn_id=...) == 2` (one header + one message).
  2. **Idempotency sanity check.** Re-publish the same data message
     after the commit lands; assert the per-`txn_id` document count
     stays at 2 (the persistence service treats matching duplicates as
     `APPEND_DUPLICATE`).
- **Profile vs `@TestPropertySource`.** Used `@DynamicPropertySource`
  inline; no new `application-integration-test.yml` profile was added.
  `@DynamicPropertySource` also runs the `AdminClient` topic creation
  *before* Spring context startup, which is the ordering hook the
  pre-work flagged as needed for pattern subscription.
- **No production-code change.** `TransactionMessageListener`,
  `TransactionMessagePersistenceService`, `KafkaIngestProperties`,
  `KafkaIngestConfig`, and `application.yml` are unchanged. The
  integration test exposed no bug in the accepted ingestion path.
- **No logback-test.xml.** Kafka-client logs are verbose but readable;
  not enough noise to justify a new test logging config.

### Files added

- `jade-tipi/src/integrationTest/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/kafka/TransactionMessageKafkaIngestIntegrationSpec.groovy`
  (new) — the spec described above. Includes a static gate method,
  `@DynamicPropertySource` overrides + topic creation, scoped Mongo
  cleanup, and inline polling helpers.

### Files unchanged

- All `jade-tipi/src/main/...` files. Production behavior is preserved.
- `jade-tipi/src/test/resources/application-test.yml`. The test profile
  still sets `jadetipi.kafka.enabled: false` so unit-test
  `@SpringBootTest` contexts (e.g. `JadetipiApplicationTests.contextLoads`)
  do not start a Kafka listener. The new integration spec re-enables
  the listener via `@DynamicPropertySource` for its own context only.
- `jade-tipi/build.gradle`. No new dependencies; `kafka-clients` and
  `spring-kafka` were already on the integration-test classpath via
  `spring-kafka` (added in TASK-003), and the integration-test source
  set already inherits both.

### Verification

Setup (project-documented):

- `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d` brings up
  `mongodb`, `keycloak`, `kafka`, and `kafka-init`.
  Verified containers: `jade-tipi-mongo` healthy, `jade-tipi-keycloak`
  healthy, `jade-tipi-kafka` healthy.

Compilation:

- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileGroovy` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileTestGroovy` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileIntegrationTestGroovy` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.

Targeted integration run (env flag set, brokers up):

- `JADETIPI_IT_KAFKA=1 ./gradlew :jade-tipi:integrationTest --tests '*TransactionMessageKafkaIngestIntegrationSpec*'`
  — BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Test report:
  `tests=2, skipped=0, failures=0, errors=0, time=5.347s` on the
  first run, `4.917s` on a `--rerun-tasks` re-run (stable).

Skip behavior (env flag NOT set, brokers up):

- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:integrationTest --tests '*TransactionMessageKafkaIngestIntegrationSpec*'`
  — BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Test report:
  `tests=2, skipped=2, failures=0, errors=0, time=0.0s`
  (Spring context never loaded, both features ignored).

Regression check on unit tests:

- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test --rerun-tasks` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
  37 tests pass:
  - `JadetipiApplicationTests` (1)
  - `TransactionMessageListenerSpec` (4)
  - `DocumentServiceMongoDbImplSpec` (9)
  - `TransactionMessagePersistenceServiceSpec` (11)
  - `TransactionServiceSpec` (12)

### How to run locally

```
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
JADETIPI_IT_KAFKA=1 ./gradlew :jade-tipi:integrationTest \
    --tests '*TransactionMessageKafkaIngestIntegrationSpec*'
```

To run the full integration suite (existing Mongo/Keycloak-backed
specs plus this new Kafka spec), drop the `--tests` filter and keep
the env flag set.

### Out-of-scope items not implemented (per directive)

- Materialization of committed records into `ent`/`ppy`/`typ`/`lnk`.
- HTTP submission wrapper.
- Kafka ACLs / OAuth-SASL / Kafka Streams / exactly-once.
- Redesign of the message envelope or persistence record shape.
- No production code changes; the integration test exposed no bug.

## TASK-003 — Persist Kafka transaction messages to txn

Goal completed. The Spring Boot backend now consumes canonical
`org.jadetipi.dto.message.Message` records from Kafka and persists them
into MongoDB's `txn` collection as the durable transaction
write-ahead log. Two record kinds live in `txn`: a header document
(`record_type=transaction`) keyed by the canonical `txn_id`, and one
message document per received `Message` (`record_type=message`) keyed
by `txn_id~msg_uuid`.

### Changes by acceptance criterion

- **Backend Kafka consumer dependencies and configurable topic pattern.**
  - `jade-tipi/build.gradle`: added
    `implementation 'org.springframework.kafka:spring-kafka'` (version
    pinned by the Spring Boot 3.5.6 BOM).
  - `jade-tipi/src/main/resources/application.yml`: added a
    `spring.kafka` block (`group-id` default `jadetipi-txn-ingest`,
    byte-array value deserializer, `enable-auto-commit: false`,
    `listener.ack-mode: MANUAL_IMMEDIATE`) and a `jadetipi.kafka`
    block (`txn-topic-pattern` default
    `jdtp-txn-.*|jdtp_cli_kli`, `enabled` default `true`,
    `persist-timeout-seconds` default `30`). Spring property
    placeholders are escaped (`\${...}`) because the project's
    `processResources` runs Groovy `expand` over `application.yml`.

- **Kafka message deserialization to `Message` via the project mapper.**
  - `jade-tipi/src/main/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/kafka/TransactionMessageListener.groovy`
    (new): a `@Component` annotated with
    `@KafkaListener(topicPattern = "${jadetipi.kafka.txn-topic-pattern}", autoStartup = "${jadetipi.kafka.enabled}", groupId = "${spring.kafka.consumer.group-id:jadetipi-txn-ingest}")`.
    Receives `ConsumerRecord<String, byte[]>` and `Acknowledgment`,
    deserializes via `org.jadetipi.dto.util.JsonMapper.fromBytes`.

- **Envelope/schema-level validation before persistence.**
  - The listener calls `message.validate()` which runs JSON Schema
    validation against `/schema/message.schema.json`. Malformed JSON
    or schema-invalid messages are logged and acknowledged (poison-pill
    skip per directive) so a single bad record does not stall the
    consumer. Persistence failures are not acknowledged, so the
    listener container retries.

- **Two `txn` record kinds with the documented shapes.**
  - Header: `_id = txnId`, `record_type = "transaction"`, `txn_id`,
    `state` (`open`/`committed`), `opened_at`, optional `commit_id`,
    `committed_at`, plus the open/commit `data` payloads under
    `open_data`/`commit_data`.
  - Message: `_id = txnId~msgUuid`, `record_type = "message"`,
    `txn_id`, `msg_uuid`, `collection`, `action`, `data`,
    `received_at`, and a `kafka` sub-doc with topic/partition/offset/
    `timestamp_ms`.

- **`txn/open` creates or confirms the header.**
  - `service/TransactionMessagePersistenceService.openHeader` upserts
    with `setOnInsert` for `opened_at` so a re-delivered open does
    not rewrite the original timestamp. Re-delivery on an existing
    header (open or already committed) returns
    `OPEN_CONFIRMED_DUPLICATE` and does not modify the document.

- **Idempotent data appends keyed by natural `_id`.**
  - `appendDataMessage` inserts with `_id = txnId~msgUuid`. On
    duplicate-key, the service reads the stored document and compares
    `(collection, action, data)` to the incoming message. Equal
    payload returns `APPEND_DUPLICATE` (success); conflicting payload
    raises `ConflictingDuplicateException` (un-acked, retried).

- **`txn/commit` assigns a backend `commit_id`.**
  - `commitHeader` reads the header and:
    - Errors with `IllegalStateException` if the header is missing
      (commit before open is un-acked, retried).
    - Returns `COMMIT_DUPLICATE` and does not call
      `idGenerator.nextId()` again if the header is already
      committed.
    - Otherwise calls `idGenerator.nextId()` for the orderable
      `commit_id`, sets `state = "committed"`, `committed_at`, and
      `commit_data` in one update, and returns `COMMITTED`.
  - Child message stamping is intentionally not implemented; readers
    are expected to resolve commit visibility via the header.
  - `txn/rollback` is treated as an explicit no-op per directive: the
    service logs and returns `ROLLBACK_NOT_PERSISTED` without writing.

- **Service stays Kafka-free and HTTP-free.**
  - `TransactionMessagePersistenceService` imports neither
    `org.apache.kafka.*` nor any web type. The listener owns all
    Kafka-client and Spring-Kafka imports. Provenance is passed in as
    `KafkaSourceMetadata` (a Groovy `@Immutable` value object), which
    has no Kafka-client dependency.

- **Tests.**
  - `jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/service/TransactionMessagePersistenceServiceSpec.groovy`
    (new, 11 features): open first time, open re-delivered (open and
    committed), data append first time, append duplicate (equal),
    append duplicate (conflicting), commit first time, commit
    duplicate (no second `nextId`), commit before open, rollback,
    and a null-message guard.
  - `jade-tipi/src/test/groovy/org/jadetipi/jadetipi/kafka/TransactionMessageListenerSpec.groovy`
    (new, 4 features): valid record persisted and acknowledged,
    unparseable bytes acknowledged without forwarding, schema-invalid
    JSON acknowledged without forwarding, persistence error not
    acknowledged.
  - `jade-tipi/src/test/resources/application-test.yml`: existing
    file updated to add `jadetipi.kafka.enabled: false` (per
    directive — no duplicate test profile created) so
    `JadetipiApplicationTests.contextLoads` does not start a
    listener container.

### Verification

- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:compileGroovy` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d mongodb` to bring
  up MongoDB (the only docker dependency `JadetipiApplicationTests.contextLoads`
  needs).
- `./gradlew :jade-tipi:test` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL. 37 tests pass,
  including `JadetipiApplicationTests.contextLoads`, the existing
  `TransactionServiceSpec`, and the two new specs above.

### Out-of-scope items deferred (with rationale)

- **Optional Kafka integration test under `integrationTest/`.**
  Per directive, the integration test was deferred because the
  project has no Testcontainers wiring and the docker stack's
  `kafka-init` sidecar pre-creates only `jdtp_cli_kli`. Service and
  listener unit specs cover the acceptance criteria. A follow-up task
  can add Testcontainers and an end-to-end integration spec.
- **Materializing committed records into `ent`/`ppy`/`typ`/`lnk`.**
  Listed in `OUT_OF_SCOPE` and not implemented.
- **HTTP submission wrapper.** Listed in `OUT_OF_SCOPE`. The
  persistence service is intentionally Kafka-free so a future HTTP
  adapter can call it without dragging in Kafka or web types.
- **Topic registration / Kafka ACLs / OAuth-SASL hardening / Kafka
  Streams / exactly-once.** Listed in `OUT_OF_SCOPE` and not
  attempted.

### Files changed
